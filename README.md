# ece241 - All Labs from ECE241 Digital Systems in Verilog
 - ECE241 course offered by University of Toronto's Faculty of Applied Science &amp; Engineering in **Fall 2024**
 - Topics include: Algebraic and truth table representation of logic functions and variables. Optimizations of combinational logic, using "don't cares." Multi-level logic optimization. Transistor-level design of logic gates; propagation delay and timing of gates and circuits. The Verilog hardware description language. Memory in digital circuits, including latches, clocked flip-flops, and Static Random Access Memory. Set-up and hold times of sequential logic. Finite state machines - design and implementation. Binary number representation, hardware addition and multiplication. Tri-state gates, and multiplexers.
 - Digital logic circuit design with substantial hands-on laboratory work. 
 - There is a major lab component using Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and associated computer-aided design software.
